        Strictly speaking there are two broad types of volcano, a stratovolcano
        and a shield volcano, although there are lots of different volcanic
        features that can form from erupted magma (such as cinder cones or lava
        domes) as well processes that shape volcanoes. In this section you can
        find out the difference between stratovolcanoes and shield volcanoes, as
        well as lava domes and calderas.

        Viscosity is important in volcanology. An eruption of highly viscous
        (very sticky) magma tends to produce steep-sided volcanoes with slopes
        that are about 30–35°. That’s because the viscous volcanic material
        doesn’t flow that far from where it is erupted, so it builds up in
        layers forming a cone-shaped volcano known as a stratovolcano. Shield
        volcanoes, on the other hand, have gentle slopes that are less than 10°
        and erupt more fluid lavas called basalt. When a shield volcano erupts,
        the basalt can flow great distances away from the vent to produce broad,
        gentle slopes

            Where a volcano produces low viscosity, runny lava, it spreads far from
            the source and forms a volcano with gentle slopes: a shield volcano.
            Most shield volcanoes are formed from fluid, basaltic lava flows. Mauna
            Kea and Mauna Loa are shield volcanoes. They are the world’s largest
            active volcanoes, rising over 9 km above the sea floor around the island
            of Hawai’i.
